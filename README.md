The objective of this project is to create a polynomial calculator. As input we have two polynomials on which we performed the next operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivation and integration. I used an interface realized in Swing (GUI toolkit) to write the polynomials and to display the results. I used regex to parse the polynomials.
